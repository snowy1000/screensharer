# Screensharer#4643
---
OK, all. Welcome to official GitHub repository for [Screensharer#4643](https://top.gg/bot/698203925580611585) Discord bot. You can check out Discord Bot List -top.gg- page by clicking 'Screensharer#4643' button. If you want to self host, OK, but if these are stolen/distributed by someone without my permission, do not forget that I'll use all my rights. 

### About self hosting
You can host this project at Glitch, at Heroku or in your own computer. All dependencies are up to date but some commands may be missing. Do not forget to filling missing information in main (screenshare.js) file, **client.conf**. If you want to create a public bot, please don't. If I see this codes are stolen, I'll use my rights, do not forget that please!

### About distributing
Please don't! At least without contacting me; you can join my Discord server by clicking [here](https://discord.gg/JajWkmj) which is better, but also sending a friend request to Snowy âœ¨#1000 is an option that you may want to consider (Sometimes I ignore friend requests, so keep this in your mind while sending a friend request -like I said, joining our Discord server is a better way to contact me).
